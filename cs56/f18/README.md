F18 Final Remarks:

1. Learn Springboot.

2. Try to refactor into Java code rather than JavaScript.

3. Finish CSSing. (App is fugly).

4. Most of the base app is there. You just need to add the matching function to fully complete the intended purpose of the app.

5. Look in issues for bugs and new feature ideas.

6. Our database works well with JavaScript. Accessing it through the admin SDK (Java) is confusing/more difficult. If you find big issues, consider switching to MongoDB or another database.

7. Long term ideas:
i: Ideally, you can input your own ingredients and it will match to an ingredient.
ii: Ideally, after creating a recipe, the ingredient should be removed from your database.
iii: Add quantities.
